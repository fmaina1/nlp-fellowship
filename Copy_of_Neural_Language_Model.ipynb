              " \"i mean of all the obscure  overlooked  low budget horror movies waiting to be re discovered in a dvd release  why pick the forest  i love ultra low budget direct to home video or other alternative release horror  i love 80s hacker horror  i love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased  murdered and eaten by psychopaths  i am all for the idea of non professionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one  i am all for using found public locations  non actors  no name talent behind the camera and in the studio  no problem  the most evocative image from the forest is it's opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods  we see them as tiny  vulnerable creatures entering a dank gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator  then the film takes a dive   never recovers   we briefly meet the backpacking couple just as they realize that they are being stalked  they get separated  both are butchered  and then we meet the movie's protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam  they meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip  sounds of snoring fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie fiddle with their cell phones text messaging people not there telling them how much the movie sucks this film is too slow  this movie is too boring  and this movie is too talky  which wouldn't be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid  asinine and unnecessary things  you know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the droopy faced park ranger who warns everyone away from the cannibal woods  and speaking of these  woods  they look about as far away from civilization as the overgrown vacant lot behind the soccer fields  only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it  there are impressive shots of the forest primeval  but no real sense of being out in the middle of it  if any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would amble by what is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest  i don't know who these couples are and don't care what happens to them  the hermit cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw freshly cooked meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend  who just happens to seek shelter in his cave  the irony of which is the epitome of  underwhelming  coupled with a deliberately ominous synthesizer music score  cinematography that suspiciously looks like someone strapped a camera on a dog and it follow people's movements  a lack of appreciable gore  nudity  lurid thrills and unwholesome atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that isn't even as frightening as a pbs educational tv show about how magnets work i don't mean to  dish it out  to the people behind this film  since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing  did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some maggot chasing women through the woods with a knife  there is nothing wrong with that concept  what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed  right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the 80 minute mark  the best thing that you can say about the forest is that it is over relatively quickly and there isn't much to command a repeat screening   hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a dvd release  it was fine as a prism video rental years oddity  as a dvd it will be  5 99 rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves  there is little or no urgency to see the film  unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods hacker set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there  here is a guide of steps to avoid making with all that said and done  the film did have one interesting sequence  or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and ineptly thought out that it becomes an enigma in an otherwise cut   dried film  the madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local contractor  he dispatches his beloved  arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the interloper  the guy corners and attacks his quarry  who sidesteps   runs away  only to have the psycho materialize in his footsteps with a bigger  badder weapon  the psycho attacks again  and the guy gets away  the psycho materializes again  and once more the guy gets away  then again  finally on the fifth try the psycho trips the dude so to fall on some sort of a bladed contraption  how did he keep materializing armed with bigger badder weapons like that  is there some supernatural element to this psycho  since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an enigma  staged to build some tension  it's purpose remains unclear  the whole film is like that really  existing without any need to be made and executed in such a ham fisted  uninteresting manner that one cannot help but wonder what the point of it was 3 10  and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on dvd that doesn't mean you necessarily should \"]"
